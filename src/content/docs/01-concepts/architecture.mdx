# Architecture 

FerrisKey is designed with a monolithic architecture built in Rust using the Axum web framework, ensuring high performance, memory safety, and operational simplicity for modern enterprise environments.

## Architecture Overview

FerrisKey follows a monolithic approach with a single, well-structured Rust application that handles all IAM operations. This design provides excellent performance, simplified deployment, and reduced operational complexity while maintaining clear internal module separation.

### Core Modules

#### Identity Module
- **User Management**: Centralized storage and management of user profiles
- **Authentication**: Identity validation through multiple methods
- **Session Handling**: Secure session management with Postgres

#### Authorization Module
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Hierarchical role system with inherited permissions
- **Bitwise Permissions**: Discord-style permission system using bitflags for efficient storage and evaluation
- **Permission Inheritance**: Roles can inherit and override permissions from parent roles
- **Resource Protection**: Fine-grained access control for APIs, endpoints, and application resources

**Bitwise Permission System**

FerrisKey uses a bitwise permission system similar to Discord, where each permission is represented by a unique bit position in a 64-bit integer. This approach provides:
- **Performance**: O(1) permission checking using bitwise operations
- **Efficiency**: Compact storage of multiple permissions in a single integer
- **Flexibility**: Easy permission combinations using bitwise OR operations
- **Scalability**: Support for up to 64 different permissions per role


```rust
pub enum Permissions {
    Read = 1 << 0,        // 00000001
    Write = 1 << 1,       // 00000010
    Execute = 1 << 2,     // 00000100
    Admin = 1 << 3,       // 00001000
}

fn has_permission(role_permissions: u64, permission: Permissions) -> bool {
    (role_permissions & permission as u64) != 0
}

fn add_permission(role_permissions: &mut u64, permission: Permissions) {
    *role_permissions |= permission as u64;
}

const READ_PERMISSION: u64 = Permissions::Read as u64;
```

#### Token Module
- **JWT Management**: Secure token generation and validation
- **Token Lifecycle**: Issuance, refresh, and revocation handling
- **Cryptographic Operations**: Digital signatures and encryption

## Technology Stack

### Core Framework
- **Rust**: Systems programming language for memory safety and performance
- **Axum**: Modern, ergonomic web framework built on Tokio
- **Tokio**: Asynchronous runtime for concurrent operations
- **Tower**: Middleware and service abstractions

### Data Layer
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for user data and configurations
- **SeaORM (sqlx)**: Compile-time checked SQL queries
