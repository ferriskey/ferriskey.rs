# Clients

Clients in FerrisKey represent applications or services that interact with your IAM system.
Each client is registered within a realm and is assigned its own credentials, roles, and permissions.

## What are Clients?

A client is an entity (such as a web app, API, or service) that needs to authenticate and authorize users or itself against FerrisKey. Clients are fundamental for enabling secure access to your applications.

- **Unique Credential**: Each client has its own client ID and secret for authentication.
- **Role Assignment**: Clients can be assigned roles that define their permissions within the realm.
- **Per-Realm Registration**: Clients are registered within a specific realm, ensuring isolation.
- **Protocol Support**: Supports OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and other standard protocols.

## Use Cases

### Application Authentication
Register web, mobile, or backend applications as clients to enable user login and secure API access.

### Service-to-Service Communication
Secure communication between microservices by registering each service as a client with its own credentials.

### Third-Party Integrations
Allow external partners or SaaS products to integrate securely by registering them as clients.


## Client Architecture


### Registration & Credentials

Clients are registered with a unique client ID and secret. These credentials are used for authentication and token requests.

```sql
CREATE TABLE clients (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    realm_id UUID REFERENCES realms(id) NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    client_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    client_secret VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    redirect_uris TEXT[],
    enabled BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Role Assignment

Roles are directly linked to a client via the `client_id` column, enabling per-client permission models within a realm.

```sql
CREATE TABLE roles (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    permissions BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    realm_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES realms(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    client_id UUID REFERENCES clients(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

- Per-Client Roles: Each role can be scoped to specific client, or left NULL for realm-wide roles.
- Fine-Grained Permissions: Assign only the necessary permissions to each client's roles.

### Security Best Practices

- Least Privilege: Assign only the required roles and permissions to each client.
- Secret Management: Store client secrets securely and rotate them regularly.
- Redirect URI Validation: Always specify and validate redirect URIs to prevent misuse.
- Audit Logging: All client authentication and authorization events are logged for compliance.
