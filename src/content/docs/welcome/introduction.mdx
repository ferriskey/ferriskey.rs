# Welcome to FerrisKey

## About FerrisKey

FerrisKey is an IAM (Identity and Access Management) solution designed to address modern **cloud-native** challenges: multi-tenant isolation, dynamic scalability, and seamless integration into distributed architectures. We developed it to offer:

- **Optimal performance** thanks to a Rust core, ensuring execution speed and low memory footprint.
- **Enhanced security** through Rust's memory guarantees and proven practices (cryptography, secrets management, JWT/OIDC).
- **Extensibility and modularity** via a hexagonal architecture (ports & adapters) facilitating the addition of new features and continuous integration.

## Why Rust?

Rust was chosen for:

1. **Memory safety**: elimination of common errors (use-after-free, data races) at compile time.
2. **High performance**: absence of garbage collector and low-level optimizations.
3. **Safe concurrency**: ownership/borrowing model that simplifies writing parallel code without fear of data races.

## Our Goals

1. **Ease of use**: intuitive web interface and ergonomic CLI.
2. **Interoperability**: native support for Helm, Kubernetes Operator, Terraform Provider.
3. **Transparency and open-source**: open code, comprehensive documentation, and active community.
4. **Continuous evolution**: user feedback guiding our roadmap and regular releases.
